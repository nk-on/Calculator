# Calculator Project

This is a simple and intuitive calculator web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The calculator supports multiple operations, allows the user to input as many operators as needed, and performs calculations only when the **equals** button is clicked. The app features three themes that can be toggled for user preference and uses the **npm math library** to handle complex expressions without relying on `eval()` for security reasons.

## Features
- **Multiple Operators:** Users can input as many operations as desired before calculating the result.
- **Manual Calculation Trigger:** The calculation is performed only when the equals (`=`) sign is pressed, allowing flexible input without automatic evaluation.
- **Theme Switching:** The app includes three different themes, allowing users to choose their preferred style.
- **Secure Expression Handling:** Utilizes the **npm math library** for secure and accurate mathematical operations without `eval()`.
